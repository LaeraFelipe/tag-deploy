## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a file in the root directory called `tag-deploy-config.json`.
You can use the example below as a starting point:

```json
{
  "global": {
    "editor": "code -w",
    "deployments": [
      {
        "name": "homolog",
        "branch": "develop",
        "modifier": "-rc"
      },
      {
        "name": "production",
        "branch": "master"
      }
    ]
  },
  "projects": []
}
```

### üìÇ Projects

You can manually configure projects by editing the `projects` array in `tag-deploy-config.json`:

```json
{
  "global": {
    "editor": "code -w",
    "deployments": [
      {
        "name": "homolog",
        "branch": "develop",
        "modifier": "-rc"
      },
      {
        "name": "production",
        "branch": "master"
      }
    ]
  },
  "projects": [
    { "name": "project-1", "path": "/path/to/project-1" }
  ]
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the interactive setup:

```bash
tag-deploy --add
```

This allows you to:

* Add a project manually.
